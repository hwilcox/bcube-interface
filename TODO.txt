* Jasmine runner in Grunt - need to fix the require runner - submit pull request
* Add cleanup methods to the backbone views and models
* SearchTerms could stand some refactoring
* CoffeeScript-up the test files
* Clean up the OpenSearch handling
  * Use the JSON data structures as inputs to pure functions
  * Wrap the OpenSearchlight response to more directly JSON-ify it
    - JSONResults should be way more lightweight - just a JSON representation of the data
    - perhaps push that out into OSL?
* improve management of src/contrib with something like Bower
* minify src/contrib to further reduce the size of the app and number of HTTP requests that are made
